			<p> 
			I'm a 19 years old French boy studying in
			<a href="https://www.edhec.edu/fr" class=hyperlink target="_blank">EDHEC</a>, a business school based in Lille. Aside from my studies, I also love mathematics and video editing. Also, I have a weird passion for random facts, I find it cool to learn cool anecdotes about everything.

			<h2>
				To continue with the facts
			</h2>
			<p>
				Here are some fun facts about me :
			</p>
			<ul class="list-not-centered">
				<li>
					My parents didn't actually make a typo with my name. However, it was my older brother, who was 4 at the time, that chose it, hence the weird spelling.
				</li>
				<li>
					I can spell spell out the alphabet backwards.
				</li>
				<li>
					I once won 4,000 euros in the lottery.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>
				Music !
			</h2>
			<p>
				Like pretty much 99.9% of the population, I love music. I've played the guitar for 5 years, and I don't think I could live without music. I know it's a pretty common thing to say, but I legit listen to music all day long, even when I sleep. My tastes are very wide since I have songs from the 80s along with French rap or even some Hard metal in my playlist.
				Here's my favorite song at the moment!

			<h2>
				Last but not least : Mangas ! 
			</h2>
			<p> 
				Animes and mangas are one of my passion among maths and video editing. Apart from making me learn a bit of Japanese, it entertains me a lot. I would really love to be able to merge editing and animes by making what is called and AMV, just like <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw8dGN2s2ps target="blank_" class=hyperlink>this video</a>. It would be a way to enjoy both of my passions.
